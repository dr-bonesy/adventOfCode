## Advent Of Code 

Advent of Code is a programming challenge created by Eric Wastl. You can read more about it [here](https://adventofcode.com/2018/about). This repo contains my solutions to these problems, as well as a bit about my thought process behind those solutions. 

### Rust

Rust is a...well, it's a lot of things to different people. For my purposes, it's a general purpose programming language that operates with the same power and flexibility as C/C++, without the footguns of the former and the ugliness of the latter. [You can read more about the language here](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

I've been leading a project in Rust for about a half year at work, and would like to be better at it at the hands on level. I stil tend to think in terms of Python and C, and I'm using this month of code as a means of forcing myself to be better at it, and a more dilligent programmer.
